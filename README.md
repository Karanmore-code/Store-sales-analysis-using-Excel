## Insights:
- Women buy more than men (~65%)
- March recorded the maximum number of sales and orders
- Successful delivery percentage is good (92%)
- Amazon is the top channel for sales (35%) followed by Flipkart (22%)
- Maharashtra, Karnataka, and UP are the top 3 states for sales (~35%)
- Age group (20-50) Adult is highest sales contributor

## Conclusion to improve sales for this store:
- Focus on women (as they are the high sales contributor) from the states from Maharashtra, Karnataka and UP. This can be done by targeting them using marketing channels along with ads/coupon codes etc. The focus would be on channels like Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra.
- Secondary strategy would be to target senior age group. However, more data is required to get insights on that.
