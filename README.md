## Insights:
- Women buy more than men (~65%)
- March recorded the maximum number of sales and orders
- Successful delivery percentage is good (92%)
- Amazon is the top channel for sales (35%) followed by Flipkart (22%)
- Maharashtra, Karnataka, and UP are the top 3 states for sales (~35%)
- Age group (20-50) Adult is highest sales contributor

## Conclusion to improve sales for this store:
- Focus on women (as they are the high sales contributor) from Maharashtra, Karnataka and UP. This can be done by targeting them using marketing channels along with ads/coupon codes etc. The focus would be on channels like Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra.
- Secondary strategy would be to target other age groups. However, more data is required to get insights on that.
